Circus Restaurant project - NE20 Frontend
A circus restaurant web page created under exercise for Lexicon group 1.
The website is mostly frontend, without the backend part so the login, create account and so on will not work.
The website was created as a result of a user survey with 25+ respondents and the group based the website design on those results.
